## Server Configuration

The following options can be configured:

| Option | Description | Default |
| ---------- | ------------- | --------- |
| `Game Profile (username)` | Hytale profile username for server authentication. Visit [accounts.hytale.com](https://accounts.hytale.com/) → Game Profiles to find your username. Leave empty to use first profile. | (empty) |
| `Asset Pack` | Assets pack (.zip) that are being send to player | `Assets.zip` |
| `Accept Early Plugins` | Acknowledge that loading early plugins is unsupported and may cause stability issues | `false` |
| `Allow Operators` | Do you wish to allow operators or not | `true` |
| `Auth Mode` | Authentication mode (authenticated or offline) | `authenticated` |
| `Automatic Update` | Update the hytale server automatically | `true` |
| `Boot Commands` | A list of commands to run when the server boots. | (empty) |
| `Enforce Permissions` | Enforce correct file permissions on startup. This may increase startup time. | `false` |
| `Event Debug` | Enables detailed debug logging for the internal event system. | `false` |
| `Force Network Flush` | Forces the network buffer to flush immediately. Can help with latency debugging. | `false` |
| `JVM Arguments` | Additional Java Virtual Machine arguments for advanced configuration. | See egg config |
| `Leverage Ahead-Of-Time Cache` | The server ships with a pre-trained AOT cache (HytaleServer.aot) that improves boot times by skipping JIT warmup | `true` |
| `Disable Sentry Crash Reporting` | Disable Sentry during active plugin development. Hytale uses Sentry to track crashes. Disable it to avoid submitting your development errors | `true` |
| `Enable Backups` | Enable automatic backups | `false` |
| `Backup Frequency` | Backup interval in minutes | `30` |
| `Maximum Backups` | The maximum number of backups to retain. Older backups will be deleted when this limit is reached. | `5` |
| `Patchline` | What release channel you want to use | `release` |
| `Persistent Authentication` | Enables caching of authentication tokens. This prevents the need to re-authenticate via the web browser on every server restart. | `ENABLED` |
| `Memory overhead` | The amount of RAM (in MB) kept aside for the system so the server doesn’t use everything. Java will get the rest. | `0` |
| `Logger Level` | Sets the logging level for specific components. Use a comma-separated list in the format LoggerName:LEVEL (for example, com.example:INFO) to control how much detail is logged. | `empty` |
| `Source Query Support` | Automatically installs the Hytale Source Query plugin, allowing external services to query server status. | `false` |
| `Validate Assets` | Causes the server to exit with an error code if assets are invalid. Leave empty to skip validation. | `false` |
| `Validate prefabs` | Forces the server to stop and exit with an error if any specified prefab types are invalid. Provide a comma-separated list of prefab categories (e.g. PHYSICS,BLOCKS,BLOCK_STATES,ENTITIES,BLOCK_FILLER) to check. Leave empty to skip validation. | `0` |
| `Validate world generation` | Causes the server to exit with an error code if world gen is invalid. Leave empty to skip validation. | `false` |

### First-Time Authentication

During the first start, the Hytale downloader will require authentication with your Hytale account. You'll see output similar to this in the console:

> [!CAUTION]
> **You must have purchased Hytale on the account you are using to authenticate.**

```txt
Please visit the following URL to authenticate:
https://oauth.accounts.hytale.com/oauth2/device/verify?user_code=XXXXXXXX
Or visit the following URL and enter the code:
https://oauth.accounts.hytale.com/oauth2/device/verify
Authorization code: XXXXXXXX
```

**To complete authentication:**

1. Open the provided URL in your web browser
2. Enter the authorization code shown in the console
3. Sign in with your Hytale account credentials
4. Authorize the server to download game files
5. Return to the console - the download will continue automatically

This authentication step is only required during initial setup. Subsequent server starts will not require re-authentication.
